### Content Guidelines ðŸ“š

In order to keep the bar as high as possible, we will add your posts only if they meet these 4 principles:

###### Content ðŸ“‘

The great Alfred Hitchcock once said: _to make a great film you need three things - the script, the script and the script._

The script is to movies as the content is to newsletters.

We're asking you to submit only what **you** think is so genuinely interesting that's worth other people's time.
Always avoid catchy titles or more-searched-terms kind of articles.

###### Bias ðŸ“¢
We're starting this open project because we love great content and because we want to make that available to you, not because we want you to read specific blogs or authors.

It's important for us that you submit articles in a fair way without obvious bias or added commentary.

###### Transparency ðŸ”¬

We won't sell anything in this newsletter. It's not our goal and should not be your goal either. We need your full transparency.

###### Freshness ðŸ—ž

In a world that is constantly changing being up to date is quite relevant.

We're not Google and we're not as strict as the PageRank algorithm, but fresh content is something we value.

### Email Structure ðŸ“š

We divided the Email template into 5 different main areas:

1. <a name="head">Headline</a>
2. <a name="email">On Email Marketing</a>

- rank your resource at the beginning based on the other links position
- mention the author (link to his twitter profile) and give credits
- brief of the description of the resource
